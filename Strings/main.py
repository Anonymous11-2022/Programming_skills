# Exercise: strings a.k.a. "Soccer on a string"ðŸ˜‰ (using operators, casting and strings).

'''
For this exercise I had to use the following website to find the necessary info:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_1988_final

'''

# Part 1 - question 1 = Create a variable for every player that scored.

scorer1 = '- Ruud Gullit'
scorer2 = '- Marco van Basten'


# Part 1 - question 2 = Create a variable for each minute of the match that a goal was scored in.

goal_0 = 32
goal_1 = 54


# Part 1 - question 3 = Create a variable that stores a string that reports on who scored when \
# using the '+' operator to concatenate the variables and cast those whose datatypes are numbers into strings.

scorers = scorer1 + ' ' + str(goal_0) + ', ' + scorer2 + ' ' + str(goal_1)


# Part 1 - question 4 = Create a variable which will store a single string of information about who scored when during the match.

report = (F'{scorer1} scored in the {goal_0}nd minute\n{scorer2} scored in the {goal_1}th minute')


# Part 2 - question 1 = Choose a player's name and store it as a string.

player = 'Frank Rijkaard'


# Part 2 - question 2 = Use â€˜slicingâ€™ and â€˜.findâ€™ to isolate and store the player's first name.

first_name = player[0:player.find(" ")]


# Part 2 - question 3 = Find out the length of the surname of the player using len().

last_name_len = len(player[player.find(" "):] [:-1])


# Part 2 - question 4 = Isolate and store the player's initial and surname.

name_short = player[0:1] + '.' + ' ' +  player[player.find(" ")+1:]


# Part 2 - question 5 = Create a chant (for when the player has scored a goal)\
# containing the playerâ€™s first name and an exclamation mark (!) x-times,\
# where â€˜xâ€™ is equal to the number of characters in the playerâ€™s first name.\
# And make sure the last character of this string is not a space!

chant = (F'{first_name}! ' * len(first_name)) [:-1]


# Part 2 - question 6 = Create a boolean check to make sure that the last character of the chant is not a space.

good_chant = (chant[-1] != ' ')
