# Programming_skills

**Preface**
Below are the exercises I have done so far during the Back-end Python Developer education. I have expanded the elaboration of all exercises by adding the questions and answers to my code. This way it becomes more clear what my code does exactly.

Furthermore I want to specify that I always try to write my code as universally as possible. This allows my code to be used for multiple situations / requests.

Enjoy reading.

P.S. I've made up the a.k.a. names for the exercises myself.ðŸ˜‰


**Exercise: Conditions a.k.a. "Old MacDonald had a farm... action"**

**What does this code do?**
This code helps farmers decide what to do in certain situations by only using: 1 â€˜functionâ€™, the â€˜ifâ€™ and â€˜elifâ€™ statements and several â€˜operatorsâ€™. A few examples of certain situations are:

-	When do the cows need to be milked?
-	When does the grass needs to be mowed etc. 

**Why is this code useful?**
Itâ€™s useful because it helped me understand how to use the â€˜ifâ€™ and â€˜elifâ€™ statements and how to combine them with several operators, like for example the â€˜==â€™ and â€˜+â€™ operators.

**How can users get started with this code?**
Users can start with this code by uncommenting one of the lines at the bottom of my code and run the code to check several outputs.

**Who can you contact for help with this code?**
For help with this code, you can contact me.

**Who maintains and contributes to this code?**
The person who maintains and contributes to this code, is me.


**Exercise: For loops a.k.a. "Knowing your abcâ€™s"**

**What does this code do?**
This code helps to search, find, sort and select specific items in lists in several ways. For example:

-	find the country with the shortest name;
-	find out how many vowels a country has;
-	form the alphabet with the use of several country names etc.

**Why is this code useful?**
Itâ€™s useful because it helped me learn how to search, sort and select specific items in a list.

**How can users get started with this code?**
Users can use this code to also learn how search, find, sort and select specific items in lists. They only need to change the names of the variables and strings to find other specific items where and if necessary.

**Who can you contact for help with this code?**
For help with this code, you can contact me.

**Who maintains and contributes to this code?**
The person who maintains and contributes to this code, is me.


**Exercise: Lists a.k.a. "Letâ€™s binge and roll"**

**What does this code do?**
This code helps to tidy up lists by sorting them and checking them to make sure that they stay tidy.

**Why is this code useful?**
Itâ€™s useful because it helped me learn how to remove many items from a list the hard way: without using a for loop. So it helped me realize how helpful for loops are.

**How can users get started with this code?**
Users can use this code to also learn how to tidy up lists by sorting them and checking them if they are still tidy. They only need to change the names of the variables and strings where and if necessary.

**Who can you contact for help with this code?**
For help with this code, you can contact me.

**Who maintains and contributes to this code?**
The person who maintains and contributes to this code, is me.


**Exercise: Strings a.k.a. "Soccer on a string"**

**What does this code do?**
This code helps to search and combine items in a string. It also helps to combine strings and integers with the help of casting.

**Why is this code useful?**
Itâ€™s useful because it helped me learn how to cast strings and integers. But most of all, this code helped me to learn how to write my code as universal as possible.

**How can users get started with this code?**
Users can use this code by filling in other playerâ€™s name and check what the output will be. This code is also perfect for users to learn how to write their code as universal as possible.

**Who can you contact for help with this code?**
For help with this code, you can contact me.

**Who maintains and contributes to this code?**
The person who maintains and contributes to this code, is me.
