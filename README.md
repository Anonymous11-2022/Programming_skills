Preface
Below are the exercises I have done so far during this education. I have expanded the elaboration of all exercises so that it becomes more clear what my code does. For example, I have added all questions to my code and I have tried to clearly indicate in the output which output belongs to which question. This way it becomes more clear in the output what my code does exactly.

Furthermore I want to specify that I always try to write my code as universally as possible. This allows my code to be used for multiple situations / requests. Enjoy reading.


Exercise – Conditions:

What does this exercise do?
This exercise helps farmers decide what to do in certain situations by only using: 1 ‘function’, the ‘if’ and ‘elif’ statements and several ‘operators’. A few examples of ‘certain situations’ are:

-	When do the cow need to be milked.
-	When does the grass needs to be mowed etc. 


Why is this exercise useful?
It’s useful because it helped me understand how to use the ‘if’ and ‘elif’ statements and how to combine them with several operators, like for example the ‘==’ and ‘+’ operators.


How can users get started with this exercise?
Users can start with this exercise by uncommenting one of the lines at the bottom of my code and run the code to check several outputs.

Exercise – For loops:

What does this exercise do?
This exercise helps to search, find, sort and select specific items in lists in several ways. For example:

-	find the country with the shortest name;
-	find out how many vowels a country has;
-	form the alphabet with the use of country names etc.


Why is this exercise useful?
It’s useful because it helped me learn how to search, sort and select specific items in  a list.


How can users get started with this exercise?
Users can use this exercise to also learn how search, find, sort and select specific items in lists. They only need to change the names of the variables and strings to find other specific items where and if necessary.


Who can you contact for help with this exercise?
For help with this exercise you can contact me.


Who maintains and contributes to this exercise?
The person who maintains and contributes to this exercise is me.


Exercise – lists:

What does this exercise do?
This exercise helps to tidy up lists by sorting them and checking them if they are still tidy.


Why is this exercise useful?
It’s useful because it helped me learn how to remove many items from a list… the hard way: without using for loop. So it helped me realize how helpful for loops are.


How can users get started with this exercise?
Users can use this exercise to also learn how tidy up lists by sorting them and checking them if they are still tidy. They only need to change the names of the variables and strings where and if necessary.


Who can you contact for help with this exercise?
For help with this exercise you can contact me.


Who maintains and contributes to this exercise?

Exercise – Strings:

What does this exercise do?
This exercise helps to search and combine items in a string. It also helps to combine strings and integers with the help of casting.


Why is this exercise useful?
It’s useful because it helped me learn how to cast strings and integers. But most of all, this exercise helped me to learn how to write my code as universal as possible.


How can users get started with this exercise?
Users can use this exercise by filling in other player’s name and check what the output will be. This exercise is also perfect for users to learn how to write their code as universal as possible.


Who can you contact for help with this exercise?
